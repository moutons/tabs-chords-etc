*Verse*  
The other day he was on is way
Comin up with a phrase to greet her
He knew just what he thought he would say
Then he saw her and it was too late

*Chorus* 
Man, I know this is the wrong way
Oh, but you can't hold me down
'Cause I've been seen with Victoria
And you can't hold me down

*Verse*
He was turning right on seventeenth
Sippin hard on lemonade
Sister says it gives you bad teeth
But I need some bitterness today

*Chorus*
Lord I know this is the wrong way
But you can't hold me down
'Cause I'm in love with Victoria
And you can't hold me down

*Verse*
He remembers the first time he saw her
It was down at Astor Place
She was steppin off the 6 train
And he was lovestruck by her face

*Chorus*
Lord I know this is the wrong way
But you can't hold me down
'Cause I'm in love with Victoria
And you can't hold me down
