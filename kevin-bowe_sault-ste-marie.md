*Intro*  
Em G D Am  
Em C D  

*Verse 1*  
Em G D Am  
From Sault Ste. Marie, all the way to Coeur D'Alene  
Em C D  
Angels on the freeway speak to me  
Crosses on the road, with names that I don't know  
A million whispers tellin' me where to go  

*Chorus*  
C G  
And I still believe,  
D Em  
In the glory of Saint Marie  
F G C  
Comin' down to shed her grace on me  

*Verse 2*  
From Galveston Bay, all the way to Grand Marais  
Highway signs whisperin' the way  
It don't matter where you're bound, they won't let you turn around  
Gettin up and fallin' down right where you lay  

*Chorus*

*Verse 3*  
I'm the last of the true believers, in the past and the fallen leaders  
Can't let go even though I know  
I've been long since left behind, left for dead and left for blind  
Maybe I have lost my mind but I do not think so  

*Chorus* 2X  
*Intro*  
End on C
