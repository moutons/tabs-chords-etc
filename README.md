# tabs-chords-etc

This repository contains the various chord transcriptions and tabs I've
collected or created over the years.  

It's also got some original compositions which were originally posted to
deadmurder.com, an oddly named songwriters' forum where you posted songs and
folks would review your stuff, which changed its name to wire.fm at some point
then went defunct around 2006, according to the Wayback machine. Alas, my
Wayback Machine-fu isn't good enough to let me figure out an entry with my
info on it, probably because they were using a bunch of nutty embeds that the
Wayback Machine didn't crawl. Quel dommage.
