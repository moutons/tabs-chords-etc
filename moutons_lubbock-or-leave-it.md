In the year of nineteen ninety-eight an uncle came to me
                                                  G  
Telling tales of cousins and a car to drive and a job waiting for me
        C                           F                    C
In Fort Collins Colorado, there's a place called the Rio Grande  
    Am                           G              C
It's a far cry from Texas, but I went to lend a hand  

I was heading west past Dalhart, Dr Pepper in my hand  
I was leaving life in Austin, gonna be a mountain man  
[blah blah] thinking 'bout them days just past  
Bid goodbye to ole Doc Holliday, that old man can kiss my ass

Well they say "Lubbock or Leave It"
               C
Like hell it's dry and hot and brown  
    Am
And I sure as hell didn't love it  
      G               C
So I up and left that town  

I pulled into some dirt eatery just past the county line  
Advertising burnt hush puppies, Chupa Chups and old pork rinds  
While filling up my gas tank, I feared for my own life  
Held my nose and left the station, went to race the center stripe  

Well they say "Lubbock or Leave It"  
Well it's dry and hot and brown  
And I sure as hell didn't love it  
So I up and left that town  

It was foggy going through Boys Town but my lights shone through the night  
Sign appeared sharp curve ahead but the town was on my right  
Pulled into their wrecked Quality Inn for a roof over my head  
Lit cigarette was in my hand because the TV hurt my head  

Well they say "Lubbock or Leave It"  
Like hell it's dry and hot and brown  
And I sure as hell didn't love it  
So I up and left that town
