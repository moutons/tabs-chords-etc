Whoa, mama  
These good times are killing me  
I need someplace where I can be miserable and lonely  
Where the beer's as stale as year old bread just cold rock to lay my head on  
Before I die of the good times  

Well, without your love I was dirty and mean  
My clothes fit tight so that the seams  
Were nigh on to busting  
But now you're here and my clothes fit right  
Getting eight hours rest 'most every night  
Someone punch me in the face before I die  

Whoa, mama  
These good times are killing me  
I need someplace where I can be miserable and lonely  
Where the beer's as stale as year old bread just cold rock to lay my head on  
Before I die of the good times  

I was hungry and greedy as a dirty old rat  
You can greet me and I'd tip my hat soon as knock you on your keister  
But these days honey I stand strong and tall  
It's your love for me or no love at all and I've been used to the latter  

Whoa, mama  
These good times are killing me  
I need someplace where I can be miserable and lonely  
Where the beer's as stale as year old bread just cold rock to lay my head on  
Before I die of the good times  

These good times are killing me  
I need someplace where I can be miserable and lonely  
Where the beer's as stale as year old bread just cold rock to lay my head on  
Before I die of the good times  
Oh darling, before I die of the good times
