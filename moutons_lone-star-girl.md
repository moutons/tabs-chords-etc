*Intro*


*Verse*
I used to see your face every time I closed my eyes  
But lately I've stopped asking myself why  
Sometimes now I'm reminded of the way you moved and breathed  
But I'm smarter now, and know that it was all a game  

I used to understand how it was always all about you  
Your focus on things immature I took as signs of a young mind  
The way you interrupted I took as having things to say  
I wish I could have seen you then with the eyes I have today  


You're a hard act to follow  
I know someday I will  
Find a way to fill the hollow  
Til then I'll drink my fill  

I seem to have left my good decisions at the door  
I'd go right out and get them but if I did I'd seem a bore  
As it is I can just enjoy this quiet conversation & if I left I'm sure that  
You would not return  

*Chorus*  
You're a Lone Star girl  
All alone in this world  
& I know I'll be getting back to you someday  


She's been the subject of some whispered conversations  
As she passes, I watch in expectation  
What it is she's planned, will she be holding out her hand  
& at the end, do I know she will return?  

*Chorus*  
She's a Lone Star girl  
At the top of her world  
& I know I will be getting back to her somehow  

[repeat chorus riff 1x]


She preparing for a social convocation  
Later at the bar we'll be indulging in libations  
Is it the tossing of her hair, or the kind of boots she wears  
Or that feeling in the air that says I will not be burned  

She's a Lone Star girl  
[continue chorus riff]  

& I know I will be getting back to you somehow
