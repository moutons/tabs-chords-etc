*Intro*  

*Verse*  
Do you think about what you're doing when you compliment yourself on your graciousness  
Does it compromise your principles to betray  
Is there venom in your smile when you're looking in his eyes, is that it?  

*Chorus*  
I hear you lie  
I hear you lie  
I hear you try  
I hear you sigh  
I hear you cry  
I see you try  

[riff]  

*Verse*  
Your hand's been in his for so long, is it that feeling you despise  
If taking the path of self-destruction through some kind of [not sure] makes one attractive, then you're beautiful  
Is it the self-respect that you've never had that lets you treat others like dirt?  

*Chorus*  
I hear your sighs  
I hear you cry  
I see you try  
I hear you lie  

*Verse*  
I'm not no saint, I'm not claiming to be - only human, of this world am I  
I'll never understand why it matters to you to be the brightest light in the room  
What a terrible burden it must be to make you push back at all the folks you love  

*Chorus*  
I hear you try  
I hear you cry  
I hear you like  
I hear you sigh  
I hear you cry  
I hear you lie  

[riff]
