# Song: Take it easy
* Artist: Hopeton Lewis
* Transcriber: Shaun Mouton

G D C Dm
This song has an odd rhythm that will take some
practice to learn. Playing along with a recording
is the way to go. It seems simple, but there are
a few out-of-sync phrases that can really throw you,
and by the end of the song the upbeat rhythm has 
slipped a bit.
