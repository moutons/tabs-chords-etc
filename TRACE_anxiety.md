D B F#m

D Bm F#m

somewhere in there you might find the following chords:

D#m G# C# G D#m

but mostly it's playing on that D B F# pattern

Eyes are tired, looking for a sign
Of anything that might give relief
Fantasizing all the things in my mind
Will I feel more me?
Punctual, waiting for a thrill
To wake me from this deep dark sleep
Blaming myself for making plans of thrill
Until the cracks I call my dreams
I know you seen it all around, my Anxiety
It likes to strut, It loves a side, oh
The side of me
Creeping through the doors
And under all my sheets
I can never sleep
It worries me
Search the world, parties, even girls
But nothing makes me feel anything
Tried to attach to anybody's hope
God, help me, get me off my knees
Over controlled, the tension leaves me hold-
Ing on to all my personal things
Now I'm out, counting every doubt
That's trying to make a fool of me
I know you've seen it all around, my Anxiety
It likes to strut, It loves a side, oh
The side of me
Creeping through the doors
And under all my sheets
I can never sleep
It worries me
Anxiety
In the seams
Anxiety
On your feet
It's right up
In the seams
Anxiety
On your feet
