*Intro*  
G C  

*Verse*  
We've been drifting away for a long time, i've been letting go  
You've said "I cannot rely on you anymore" you cannot rely on me  
I've been drifting away for a long time you cannot rely on me  
I cannot rely on you, you said  

*Chorus*  
My heart's been drifting around downtown without your hand to hold it down  
My heart's been drifting around downtown without your hand to hold it high  
My heart's been falling around downtown  

*Verse*  
You're coming up to me in the halls, I'd like to help you build your walls  
My heart's pushing me to the side, you're coming out of me tonight  

*Chorus 2*  
My heart's been falling around downtown without your hand to hold it  
My time's been wasted without you, I can't be anything I doubt you now  
My heart's been falling around downtown without you  
You said I cannot rely on you, well now then you cannot rely on me  
I cannot believe my ears  

*Coda*  
My heart's been drifting around downtown without your hand to hold it  
My heart's been falling around downtown without your hands to hold it  
My heart's been drifting around downtown without your hand to hold it  
My heart's been falling around downtown without your hands to hold it down
